# AStar-BFS-Visiualizer</br>
![](visualizer.gif)</br>
Visualiztion of Shortest distance between 2 points using A* Algorithm and BFS (Dijkstraâ€™s) Algorithm. Build using python. </br> </br>
Use left click to build start, end point and walls and right click to erase them. <br>
Choose the algorithm from the buttons below and it will demostrate the shortest path between the points avoiding the walls. </br>
I implemented this in python and used pygame to create GUI. <br>
Make sure to install pygame first. </br>
